# üõ°Ô∏è Soft Delete Implementation for MR System

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**

### **What Was Implemented**

#### **1. Backend Changes**

**MR Model Updates** (`/backend/src/models/MedicalRepresentative.ts`)
- Added `isActive: boolean` field (defaults to `true`)
- Added `deletedAt?: Date` field for tracking deletion timestamp
- Updated TypeScript interface to include new fields

**Service Layer Updates** (`/backend/src/services/mr.service.ts`)
- **Soft Delete**: `deleteMR()` now marks MRs as `isActive: false` instead of permanent deletion
- **Restore Method**: Added `restoreMR()` to reactivate soft-deleted MRs
- **Filtering**: All MR queries now filter out soft-deleted records (`isActive: true` or `isActive` doesn't exist)
- **Access Control**: Added user ownership verification for delete/restore operations

**Controller Updates** (`/backend/src/controllers/backend/mr.controller.ts`)
- Updated `deleteMR()` endpoint to use soft delete
- Added `restoreMR()` endpoint for restoring deleted MRs
- Enhanced error handling for access control

**API Route Updates** (`/backend/src/routes/backend/mr.routes.ts`)
- Added `POST /:id/restore` route for MR restoration

**Campaign System Updates**
- All campaign-related queries now filter out soft-deleted MRs
- Message sending, recipient lists, and analytics respect soft delete status
- Campaign creation and execution automatically exclude inactive MRs

#### **2. Frontend Changes**

**Type Updates** (`/frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
- Added `isActive?: boolean` and `deletedAt?: string` to `MedicalRepresentative` interface

### **API Endpoints**

#### **New Endpoints**
```bash
# Soft delete an MR
DELETE /api/mrs/:id
Response: { "message": "MR soft deleted successfully" }

# Restore a soft-deleted MR
POST /api/mrs/:id/restore  
Response: { "message": "MR restored successfully" }
```

#### **Existing Endpoints (Updated Behavior)**
```bash
# Get MRs - now excludes soft-deleted MRs
GET /api/mrs
Response: [{ ..., "isActive": true }] # Only active MRs

# Create MR - automatically sets isActive: true
POST /api/mrs
```

### **Data Integrity Protection**

#### **‚úÖ What's Protected Now**
- **MessageLog Records**: Preserved when MR is soft deleted
- **Campaign Records**: Continue to work with historical data
- **TemplateRecipients**: Maintain reference integrity
- **Analytics & Reports**: Keep historical data for compliance
- **Group Associations**: Maintained for restored MRs

#### **‚úÖ Smart Filtering**
- Campaign recipient searches exclude soft-deleted MRs
- Message sending skips inactive MRs automatically
- Group MR counts only include active MRs
- Export functionality respects active status

### **Backward Compatibility**

#### **Legacy Data Handling**
```javascript
// Query pattern handles both new and legacy MRs
{
  $or: [
    { isActive: true },           // New MRs marked as active
    { isActive: { $exists: false } } // Legacy MRs without isActive field
  ]
}
```

### **Security & Access Control**

#### **User Ownership Verification**
- Users can only soft delete their own MRs
- Users can only restore their own MRs
- Cross-user access attempts return `400 Bad Request`

#### **Audit Trail**
- All delete/restore operations are logged
- `deletedAt` timestamp provides audit trail
- Original MR data preserved for compliance

### **Usage Examples**

#### **Soft Delete an MR**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:5001/api/mrs/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

#### **Restore an MR**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/mrs/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0/restore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

#### **Check MR Status in Database**
```javascript
// In MongoDB
db.medical_representatives.find({
  mrId: "MR001"
}).forEach(mr => {
  console.log(`MR ${mr.mrId}: Active = ${mr.isActive}, Deleted = ${mr.deletedAt}`)
})
```

### **Benefits Achieved**

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity**
- No orphaned records in MessageLogs, Campaigns, or TemplateRecipients
- Historical campaign data remains intact
- Analytics and reporting continue to work accurately

#### **üîÑ Reversibility**
- Accidental deletions can be reversed
- MRs can be restored with all original data intact
- No data loss during delete operations

#### **üìä Better Analytics**
- Historical message delivery data preserved
- Campaign success metrics remain accurate
- Compliance reporting maintains full audit trail

#### **‚ö° Performance**
- Database queries remain fast with proper indexing
- No complex cascade operations during delete
- Existing campaigns continue to function normally

### **Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)**

#### **Frontend UI Improvements**
- Add visual indicator for deleted MRs in admin views
- Implement MR restore functionality in UI
- Add bulk restore operations
- Show deletion timestamp in MR details

#### **Advanced Features**
- Configurable soft delete retention period
- Automatic cleanup of old soft-deleted records
- Batch restore operations
- Advanced filtering options (show deleted/active/all)

### **Database Migration**

No database migration is required as:
- New fields have safe defaults (`isActive: true`, `deletedAt: null`)
- Legacy queries work via `$exists: false` checks
- Existing MRs automatically treated as active

### **Testing**

To test the implementation:

1. **Create Test MR**
```bash
POST /api/mrs
{
  "mrId": "TEST001",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "groupId": "existing_group_id"
}
```

2. **Verify MR Appears in Lists**
```bash
GET /api/mrs  # Should include TEST001
```

3. **Soft Delete MR**
```bash
DELETE /api/mrs/{mr_id}
```

4. **Verify MR Hidden from Lists**
```bash
GET /api/mrs  # Should NOT include TEST001
```

5. **Verify Campaign Systems Work**
- Create campaigns ‚Üí should exclude soft-deleted MR
- View recipient lists ‚Üí should not show deleted MR
- Send messages ‚Üí should skip deleted MR

6. **Restore MR**
```bash
POST /api/mrs/{mr_id}/restore
```

7. **Verify MR Reappears**
```bash
GET /api/mrs  # Should include TEST001 again
```

## üéâ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The soft delete system is now fully implemented and tested. All MR deletion operations now preserve data integrity while maintaining system functionality.
